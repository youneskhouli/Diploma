# Diploma
My diplom project in Python, stock price protection with deep learning.
Using TensorFlow.


The purpose of the project is the development of a neural network
forecasting system for the value of shares. The system being developed should be a
multi-layer network, and develop an in-depth training model for forecasting the
stock of the S & P 500 based on 500 cents per minute.
Python and Tensorflow are the most common link for in-depth training.
TFlearn is a high-level framework built on top of Tensorflow. Another common
framework is Keras. He has more options, but I find the syntax of TFlearn more
simple and understandable. Both frameworks work on top of Tensorflow.
TensorFlow is the leader in the field of in-depth training. Its flexibility and
performance allow researchers to develop all kinds of complex neural network
architectures, as well as other machine learning algorithms.
I scraped minutely S&P 500 data from the Google Finance API. The data
consisted of index as well as stock prices of the S&P’s 500 constituents. Having
this data at hand, the idea of developing a deep learning model for predicting the
S&P 500 index based on the 500 constituent’s prices one minute ago came
immediately on my mind
Playing around with the data and building the deep learning model with
TensorFlow was fun and so I decided to write my first Medium.com story: a little
TensorFlow tutorial on predicting S&P 500 stock prices. What you will read is not
an in-depth tutorial, but more a high-level introduction to the important building
blocks and concepts of TensorFlow models. The Python code I’ve created is not
optimized for efficiency but understandability
